  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3, no changes required.

    - bump year for myself for the current one
  * Set section oldlibs and priority extra for all the transitional packages.

    - ruby-kde4-dbg: make it break/replace kdebindings-dbg
    - add ${misc:Depends} to the packages lacking it
    - improve descriptions
    - require smoke-dev-tools, libsmokeqt4-dev, libsmokekde-dev, and
      libqtruby4shared-dev >= 4.7.1
